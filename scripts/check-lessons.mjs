/**
 * Lessons live in two files on purpose.
 *
 * `lessons.md` is the one-line rule for each lesson and is what a session reads
 * at start. `lessons-evidence.md` holds the war stories and anchors and is
 * opened only when a rule is in doubt. Telling an agent to read part of one
 * large file does not work — reading a file reads all of it — so the split is
 * what actually keeps the session-start cost small.
 *
 * Two files, not one per lesson. Anthropic's progressive-disclosure guidance
 * groups reference material by domain rather than by item, and expects a
 * reference file of a hundred-odd lines to be normal. Split the evidence file by
 * subsystem if it outgrows that; splitting per lesson would trade a cheap read
 * for dozens of files and make reading all the lessons about one subsystem
 * expensive again.
 *
 * Splitting is only safe if the halves cannot drift, which is what this checks:
 * every rule has an entry, every entry has a rule, and every link resolves.
