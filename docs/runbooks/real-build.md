# Real-booklet build runbook

This runbook operates the retained set 6651557 reconstruction. It is developer-only experimental tooling: it does not drive the web studio's **Instructions** control, contact a production companion, or apply a patch to a user's document.

The current measured result and next blocker belong only in [building-system.md](../design/building-system.md). Keep this file about reproducible operation.

## Prerequisites

Run every command from the repository root after completing the [README setup](../../README.md#requirements-and-setup).

The uncommitted, gitignored source booklet must be available as `recipes/6651557.pdf` in this checkout or a parent checkout that the test fixture can discover. Never commit the booklet.

The probe also consumes retained callout, identification, official-model, Builder-geometry, transition, coverage, calibration, compatibility, and action-ledger inputs. Regenerable inputs live under ignored paths; the blind pair-judging truth at `scripts/fixtures/part-identification-truth-first50.json` is a tracked evidence input because it cannot be reconstructed from the booklet alone. Authoritative defaults and override variables are declared in `apps/web/e2e/real-build-input-files.ts`; a missing or stale input is a named refusal, not permission to substitute data.

## Run the retained build

The real build is skipped during ordinary Playwright runs. Set `LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REQUIRED=1` to enable it. `LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP` is optional, defaults to 12, and must be an integer from 1 through 359; choose the range needed for the experiment rather than copying a frontier into this runbook.

```powershell
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REQUIRED = "1"
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP = "12"
npx.cmd playwright test apps/web/e2e/real-build.spec.ts
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REQUIRED -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The default output root is `output/real-build`. A successful publication writes a verified immutable run under `output/real-build/runs/<run-id>/` and updates `runs/current.json`; a refused or interrupted publication must not replace that pointer. `LEGO_REAL_BUILD_OUT` may redirect the run only to another traversal-free descendant of `output/`.

## Regenerate catalog-derived inputs

Use the chain entry point instead of rebuilding later artifacts by hand. It preserves this order:

1. Validate the reviewed Builder source pins in `apps/web/e2e/real-build-builder-sources.ts`; the command refuses and changes nothing if those source pins are stale.
2. Rebuild `output/real-build/catalog-coverage.json` only when `LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REGENERATE_COVERAGE=1` is also set.
3. Rebuild `output/real-build/builder-canonical-calibration.json`.
4. Rebuild `output/real-build/action-ledger.json` against the coverage, calibration, transition classifications, and official model.

If stage 1 refuses, update the reviewed `BUILDER_STEP1_DESIGN_SOURCES` digests in the same catalog-truth change that requires them; do not bypass the refusal or regenerate later stages first.

Set the coverage flag when the catalog, callout manifest, or identification closure changed. Omit it only when the retained coverage is deliberately being reused.

```powershell
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REGENERATE_INPUTS = "1"
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REGENERATE_COVERAGE = "1"
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP = "12"
npx.cmd playwright test apps/web/e2e/real-build-inputs.spec.ts
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REGENERATE_INPUTS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_REGENERATE_COVERAGE -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The transition-classification bundle is booklet-derived input to stage 4, not a catalog-derived stage. Republish it first when the booklet or transition classifier changes:

```powershell
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_PUBLISH_TRANSITIONS = "1"
npx.cmd playwright test apps/web/e2e/real-build-transitions.spec.ts
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_PUBLISH_TRANSITIONS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

For a ledger-only rebuild, after proving stages 1 through 3 and the transition bundle are current:

```powershell
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_PUBLISH_ACTION_LEDGER = "1"
$env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP = "12"
npx.cmd playwright test apps/web/e2e/real-build-action-ledger.spec.ts
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_PUBLISH_ACTION_LEDGER -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:LEGO_REAL_BUILD_LAST_STEP -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Prefer the ordered chain whenever catalog-derived input may have moved.

## Evidence lifecycle

Booklets, source payloads, generated inputs, screenshots, scoreboards, run directories, and replay closures stay under ignored roots. Preserve artifacts used by an active run or an unresolved finding; remove only inactive task-owned evidence after its conclusion and provenance have been recorded in tracked documentation or promoted deliberately into a regression fixture.
